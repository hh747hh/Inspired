# Inspired - MEAN Stack App to introduce you inspirational TED videos

## Overview  
[** Inspired **](https://arcane-inlet-63837.herokuapp.com/) is a MEAN(Mangodb, Express, Angular, Node) Stack web application to introduce you inspirational TED videos.

I am a self motivator. I learn from the people that I meet, the videos I watch, the articles and books I read. I believe that I learn something valuable from everyone I meet no matter how old they are or what background they have. This app is to share this inspiration.
